# generator-mean-seed

[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) Generator for [MEAN-seed](https://github.com/jackrabbitsgroup/mean-seed) - MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js + Yeoman (Grunt, Bower, Yo) + Jasmine, Karma, Protractor


## Getting Started

Install Yeoman Yo, Bower, & Grunt if you haven't already:
```
$ npm install -g yo bower grunt-cli
```

Install this generator:
```
$ npm install -g generator-mean-seed
```

Naviagate to a (new) directory where you want to create your AngularJS and node.js app and initiate the generator then follow the prompts:
```
$ yo mean-seed
```
NOTE: you can also (first) create a `yo-configs` folder with .json files for the prompts so you don't have to type them all out. This is useful for storing multiple different configurations for different projects - just tell the generator which config to use and you're all set! See the [yo_configs folder](https://github.com/jackrabbitsgroup/generator-mean-seed/tree/master/yo-configs) for examples.


### Next Steps
- See the generated README.md file in your new mean-seed app!


## Getting To Know Yeoman

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
