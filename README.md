# generator-mean-seed

[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) Generator for [MEAN-seed](https://github.com/jackrabbitsgroup/mean-seed) - MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js + Yeoman (Grunt, Bower, Yo) + Jasmine, Karma, Protractor


## Getting Started

Install Yeoman Yo, Bower, & Grunt if you haven't already:
```
$ npm install -g yo bower grunt-cli
```

Install this generator:
```
$ npm install -g generator-mean-seed
```

Naviagate to a (new) directory where you want to create your AngularJS and node.js app and initiate the generator then follow the prompts:
```
$ yo mean-seed
```
NOTE: you can also (first) create a `yo-configs` folder with .json files for the prompts so you don't have to type them all out. This is useful for storing multiple different configurations for different projects - just tell the generator which config to use and you're all set! See the [yo_configs folder](https://github.com/jackrabbitsgroup/generator-mean-seed/tree/master/yo-configs) for examples.


### Next Steps
- See the generated README.md file in your new mean-seed app!
